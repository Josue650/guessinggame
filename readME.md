## Inspiration for Game
Its a bit nerdy but in school my best subject was math and we had a bunch of number guessing game battles. So that was something that resonate with me as kid


## Rules for Game
-The game is built of 3 diffrent  levels.

-The user has 3 chances to guess the number.

-The first level the guess is 0 - 10 if the number is guessed correct you move to level 2.

-Level 2 will let you guess a number between 0 - 20 is guessed correct you move to level level 3.

-Level 3 is the hard level and final level guess the number from 0 - 30

Instructions for the game are simple

-The user just has to imput a number in order to play.

-Next step is to click submit your guess to start playing

-If you guess the number in under 3 you move on and it tracks your score.

-If you dont guess in 3 you lose and have to start all over
